# Structurizr on-premises installation

The Structurizr on-premises installation is a standalone version of Structurizr that can be run locally on your own
infrastructure. Itâ€™s a Jakarta EE/Spring 6 web application, packaged as a .war file, for deployment into any
compatible Jakarta EE server, such as Apache Tomcat 10. For ease of deployment, by default,
all data is stored on the local file system.
